## Project Introduction

The Aim of the Project is to provide the best areas in the BANGALORE to invest in for a national real estate developer, individual buyers looking for a place to develop a new apartment building or to purchase one.
The main goal of project is to predict the efficient house pricing for real estate in BANGALORE.
We have developed a website that will show price prediction based on land size, land location, no of bedrooms and bathrooms in BANGALORE.

### Technologies Used

* Python as Programming Language
* Pandas for Data Cleaning
* matplotlib for Data Visualization
* sklearn for Model Building
* HTML, CSS & JS for Frontend
* Flask for Backend Server

## Project Description

I have built a Real Estate Price Prediction using fundamentals of Data Scicence and Machine Learning like
Feature Engineering, Data Cleaning, One Hot Encoding, Outlier Detection, Dimensionality Reduction, and Model Evaluation.
We have implemented a Linear Regression Model to predict the Real Estate Price. 

The Project has a Website Made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as frontend and a Flask Server as backend where inputs are taken and predictions are made.
